# Icecream Shop Website
I designed and experimented with the web design along the making to finally get this result. All of the content was coded vanilla and this website was a test to myself to prove all the knowledge I adquired at that point in my learning process of being a Software Engineer. It's the first website I made, including the design, fully responsive and flexive.
